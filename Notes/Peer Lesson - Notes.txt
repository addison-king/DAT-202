DAT 202 - Data Analytics 2
	Week 06
	Peer Lesson - ARMA
	
What is ARMA?

What is AR?
	"Autoregressive" model
	You're trying to predict something based on past "lag" values:
		"What is the price going to be today, based on the price yesterday, last week, last month, last year?"
	Could be the price of houses, stockmarket, quantity of eggs, weather
	Notation:
		Xt = cost today
		Xt-1 = cost last month
		Xt-12 = cost last year
		"Lag" = the time variable. Ex: 1 day ago, 2 days ago :: lag1, lag2
			We want to use lags that are statistically meaningful, either positive or negative.
				That is, the lag has a direct correlation to the price today.
			We don't want to use all the lags. If a lags relation is close to zero and we use it, it will make our model noisy and inaccurate.
	Model:
		B0 + B1*Mt-1 + B2*Mt-2 + ... + Bn*Mt-n + E
		Bn 		= some coefficient
		Mt-n 	= lag value
		E 		= error
	
What is MA?
	"Moving Average" model
	You're trying to predict something based on past error values
	Value today = baseline_value + coefficient*Error_t-1
	So each month (hour, day, year, etc) you start with a baseline value. Then you add to it the multiplication of a coefficient and how much you were off by last month.
	
	Residual Error - Differences between predicted and observed
	
	MA(1) = using the error from 1 time interval ago
			F_hat_t = M + Φ1*εt-1
	MA(2) = using the error from 2 most recent time intervals ago
			F_hat_t = M + Φ1*εt-1 + Φ2*εt-2
	Actual Number(1) 
			F_t = M + Φ1*εt-1 + εt
			
			

How to use them together?
	Auto-Regressive Moving Average model
	ARMA(1,1)
		AR(1) = AR lag=1
		MA(1) = MA error from 1 time interval ago
		f_t = ß_0 + ß_1*f_t-1 + Φ1*εt-1 + εt
			f_t = the value we are wanting
			ß_0 = constant
		AR>	ß_1*f_t-1 = coefficient * value from last time
		MA>	Φ1*εt-1 = coefficient * error from last time
			εt = error for right now
		predicted value:	
			f_hat_t = ß_0 + ß_1*f_t-1 + Φ1*εt-1
