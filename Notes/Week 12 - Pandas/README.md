# Data manipulation &amp; cleaning in Pandas

## Review

In case anyone needs it, there's a folder in this directory labeled `numpy_pandas_review`, with Coral's intro to NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas from DAT-119. (If this doesn't feel like a DAT-119 review to you, it may not be; we don't always get to it during a 14-week semester.)

Eric's module from DAT-129 is [available on his website](https://technologyrediscovery.net/python/mod-analytics.html).

## A video covering the next thing I'd have put in this notebook

* [How do I handle missing values in pandas?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCMrO_VzeL8)

## Interesting readings for after going through the notebook

* [4 tricks you should know to parse date columns with Pandas read_csv()](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-tricks-you-should-know-to-parse-date-columns-with-pandas-read-csv-27355bb2ad0e)
* [Why we should use the new Pandas string type instead of object](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-we-need-to-use-pandas-new-string-dtype-instead-of-object-for-textual-data-6fd419842e24)
* [Pandas GroupBy](https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/) - goes a lot deeper into it than I did

## Questions I'd like you to answer tonight :)
